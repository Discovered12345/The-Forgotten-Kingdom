# The Forgotten Kingdom

## üåç Website Purpose

This website is a one-page digital showcase dedicated to **Ancient Nubia**, a powerful and influential African civilization that flourished along the Nile River in present-day Sudan and southern Egypt. It seeks to make the legacy of Nubia more accessible to students, educators, and the general public through a clean, engaging, and mobile-friendly design.

## üéØ Focus of the Website

The focus of this website is on the **historical timeline**, **cultural achievements**, and **global impact** of the three major Nubian kingdoms:

- **Kerma** (c. 2500‚Äì1500 BCE)
- **Napata** and the 25th Dynasty of Egypt (c. 750‚Äì656 BCE)
- **Mero√´** (c. 300 BCE‚Äì350 CE)

Special emphasis is given to the **Black Pharaohs**, the **role of Nubian women in power**, and the **distinct architectural and metallurgical innovations** of the Meroitic period.

## üìù Why This Story?

Ancient Nubia has often been overshadowed by its northern neighbor, Egypt. Mainstream history textbooks frequently marginalize its contributions or falsely present Nubians as imitators rather than innovators. In reality, Nubia was:

- A **peer civilization** to Egypt with its own writing system, religion, and governing structure
- The seat of powerful monarchs, some of whom ruled both Nubia and Egypt
- Home to **the largest collection of pyramids in Africa**, located at sites like Mero√´ and Nuri
- A central hub in early African metallurgy, particularly iron

Bringing awareness to Ancient Nubia promotes a more **inclusive and accurate** understanding of global history and highlights Africa‚Äôs foundational role in human civilization.
